# Introduction

*Macroid* is the most badass modular functional user interface creation language for Android, implemented with Scala macros.
[Some people say](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=macroid) itâ€™s also a dead noodle.

Striving to be focused on one thing (GUI), *Macroid* promotes composability, high-level abstractions and advanced features,
like functional-reactive programming.

Prerequisites: Scala `2.10.x` or `2.11.x`, Android `API 11+`.
