# Tweaks

The idea behind tweaks is that widget styles and behaviors should be as composable as widget layouts themselves.

## What are they

A tweak is something that changes a property of a widget. More precisely,
it is defined by a function `WidgetClass ⇒ Unit`.

## Defining

You can use the `Tweak` companion object to define tweaks:

```scala
import macroid.Tweak

val bringToFront = Tweak[View] { view ⇒
  view.bringToFront()
}

def text(str: String) = Tweak[TextView](_.setText(str))
```

## Composing

Tweaks can be composed simply by using the `+` operator. For example:

```scala
def textAndBringToFront(str: String) =
  text(str) + bringToFront
```

The execution order is the same as the composition order, so in this case
first the caption will be set and then `bringToFront` will be called.

## Tweaking

Tweaking is one of *Macroid*’s most powerful operations ([here’s why](Advanced.html)). We’ve already seen this example:

```scala
textView <~ text("Hi")
```

In fact, we can chain a few tweaks in one operation:

```scala
textView <~ text("Hi") <~ show
```

As you may already know, tweaking returns a [UI action](UiActions.html):

```scala
val textView2: Ui[TextView] =
  textView <~ text("Hi") <~ show
```

Note that tweaking does not require the widgets to be created with *Macroid* bricks.

## Standard tweaks

A number of standard tweaks are included. You can always find them in the [scaladoc](../api/macroid/Tweaks$.html).
Note that all these tweaks can be imported with `import macroid.FullDsl._` or just `import macroid.Tweaks._`.

A quick rundown:

* Basic tweaks
  * `id` — set the id
  * `wire` — wire to a slot (see [Searching](Searching.html#slots-and-wires))
* Visibility
  * `hide`
  * `show`
* Enabling/disabling
  * `enable`
  * `disable`
* Padding
  * `padding` — supports named arguments. Example:

    ```scala
    w[TextView] <~ padding(top = 8 dp, bottom = 8 dp)
    ```
* Layout
  * `layoutParams` / `lp` — works with any layout. Example:

    ```scala
    w[Button] <~ lp[LinearLayout](MATCH_PARENT, WRAP_CONTENT, 1.0f)
    ```
  * `vertical`
  * `horizontal`
  * `addViews` — add views to a ViewGroup. Example:

    ```scala
    val views = List("foo", "bar").map(s ⇒ w[TextView] <~ text(s))
    linearLayout <~ addViews(views, removeOld = true)
    ```
* Text/captions
  * `text`
* Handling events
  * `On` — works with (almost) any events. Expects a [UI action](UiActions.html) that takes no arguments and returns the same type as the associated listener. Examples:

    ```scala
    w[Button] <~ On.click(textView <~ hide)

    w[Button] <~ On.longClick((textView <~ show) ~ Ui(true))

    l[SwipeRefreshLayout](
      ...
    ) <~ On.refresh[SwipeRefreshLayout](Ui(...))
    ```
  * `FuncOn` — the same as `On`, but takes arguments, as specified by the listener. Example:

    ```scala
    w[StaggeredGridView] <~
      FuncOn.itemClick[StaggeredGridView] { (_: AdapterView[_], _: View, index: Int, _: Long) ⇒
        ...
      }
    ```

## Extra tweaks

Some extra tweaks are included in the `macroid.contrib` package. Please refer to the [scaladoc](../api/macroid/contrib/package.html).
